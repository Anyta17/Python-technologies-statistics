Senior Python Backend Engineer (non-web development),"Drive-thru restaurants have employees multi-task by taking orders, packing food, taking payments, and more. This translates to long wait times and extremely high stress for employees. Currently, the restaurants are experiencing a major hiring crisis due to this extreme stress and increasing minimum wage.<br>Most quick-service restaurants had begun to search for a more elegant solution that improves customer experience, increases speed, accuracy, average ticket size, and reduces employee stress.<br>Our AI greets the customer, takes the order, and inserts it into the point of sale freeing up the employees to focus on other tasks.<br>Understanding an order in the drive-thru using voice is not an easy task and requires deep technology to get to the required high completion rate of orders. The challenges include a very noisy environment, unique speech patterns due to the customer's indecisiveness, different accents, gender, ages, speech from other people in the car, complex multi-turn unstructured conversation, low latency, and more. In order to solve big challenges, we are developing our own speech and natural language understanding tech from the ground up.<br><br>We are a group of experts in Speech, NLU, and Backend SW.

Python Voice Application Developer Senior,"Work will include developing voice applications using existing services to interface with proprietary systems. You will be working in a team of two to adapt and add to Neon AI's existing open-source voice assistant, to fulfill another company's project. That project is confidential, and a non-disclosure agreement will be required. You can learn more about the existing project you'll be adapting and building on through these links: <br><br>Description on the Neon AI Website: https://neon.ai/<br>Documentation: https://neongeckocom.github.io/neon-docs/neon_core/  <br>GitHub Repositories: https://github.com/NeonGeckoCom  <br><br>A specification document has been produced for the project, and the Neon AI development team will be available to provide coaching and answer questions on the use of their open-source software. This is phase 1 of a potentially much larger project, and we expect it to take 160-220 hours of work from the team, or about 5 weeks total. We are looking for candidates with the base skills and experience listed, who are excited about learning to use Neon AI's voice application and services. Phase 1 of this project should provide only a modest challenge for anyone with those competencies, making it a perfect place to start. We anticipate candidates will need 20-40 hours to familiarize themselves with the existing voice application and services before getting going on the project and will pay for that time. Ideal candidates for this team will be interested in staying with the project past phase 1, using the skills and knowledge base they've acquired to implement more ambitious future project goals. <br><br>This is a project with defined goals and a high priority on meeting deadlines, in a supportive working environment. It is a great opportunity to add to your skills and experience working with voice applications, and one which will likely lead to a longer-term position. <br><br>Voice Application Developer Recruitment Criteria<br><br>General Qualifications:<br><br>Strong technical skills<br><br>Strong project management skills<br><br>Strong self-management skills<br><br>Problem solving skills<br><br>Available for long term project<br><br>Experience working with:<br><br>GitHub<br><br>Linux dev environment (local)<br><br>Python<br><br>Docker & Kubernetes container platforms<br><br>Cloud services / connections<br><br>Preference for background in:<br><br>Speech recognition technology<br><br>Voice processing<br><br>Open Source<br><br>Linguistics / formal languages / language parsing / RegEx"

Strong Senior Python developer,"<b>About the project </b><br><br>Artificial intelligence is the steam engine of the fourth industrial revolution with a significant impact on all our lives. However, modern AI algorithms are powerful but dangerous black boxes that can cause significant financial and physical harm.

Python Voice Application Developer Senior,"Work will include developing voice applications using existing services to interface with proprietary systems. You will be working in a team of two to adapt and add to Neon AI's existing open-source voice assistant, to fulfill another company's project. That project is confidential, and a non-disclosure agreement will be required. You can learn more about the existing project you'll be adapting and building on through these links: <br><br>Description on the Neon AI Website: https://neon.ai/<br>Documentation: https://neongeckocom.github.io/neon-docs/neon_core/  <br>GitHub Repositories: https://github.com/NeonGeckoCom  <br><br>A specification document has been produced for the project, and the Neon AI development team will be available to provide coaching and answer questions on the use of their open-source software. This is phase 1 of a potentially much larger project, and we expect it to take 160-220 hours of work from the team, or about 5 weeks total. We are looking for candidates with the base skills and experience listed, who are excited about learning to use Neon AI's voice application and services. Phase 1 of this project should provide only a modest challenge for anyone with those competencies, making it a perfect place to start. We anticipate candidates will need 20-40 hours to familiarize themselves with the existing voice application and services before getting going on the project and will pay for that time. Ideal candidates for this team will be interested in staying with the project past phase 1, using the skills and knowledge base they've acquired to implement more ambitious future project goals. <br><br>This is a project with defined goals and a high priority on meeting deadlines, in a supportive working environment. It is a great opportunity to add to your skills and experience working with voice applications, and one which will likely lead to a longer-term position. <br><br>Voice Application Developer Recruitment Criteria<br><br>General Qualifications:<br><br>Strong technical skills<br><br>Strong project management skills<br><br>Strong self-management skills<br><br>Problem solving skills<br><br>Available for long term project<br><br>Experience working with:<br><br>GitHub<br><br>Linux dev environment (local)<br><br>Python<br><br>Docker & Kubernetes container platforms<br><br>Cloud services / connections<br><br>Preference for background in:<br><br>Speech recognition technology<br><br>Voice processing<br><br>Open Source<br><br>Linguistics / formal languages / language parsing / RegEx"

Strong Senior Python developer,"<b>About the project </b><br><br>Artificial intelligence is the steam engine of the fourth industrial revolution with a significant impact on all our lives. However, modern AI algorithms are powerful but dangerous black boxes that can cause significant financial and physical harm.
